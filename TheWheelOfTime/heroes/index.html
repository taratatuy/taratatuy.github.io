            <h3>Chapter 1: The Hook</h3>

            <li><a class="name" name="Lan">al'Lan Mandragoran</a>, NS,
              p. 11—Uncrowned
              king of Malkier, a nation now swallowed by the Great Blight, and the
              son of <a href="#Akir">al'Akir</a> and <a href="#Leanna">el'Leanna</a>,
              the last king and queen of Malkier. He is very tall, with long hair
              that he wears back with the <i>hadori</i>, a braided leather strap
              traditionally worn by Malkieri men. At his birth, shortly before the
              Trollocs overran Malkier and the Blight consumed his homeland, Lan was
              given four gifts (while still in his cradle): a gold signet ring, a
              locket, a sword, and an oath. Lan and his surviving Malkieri companions
              are the last of their people. He prefers to avoid Aes Sedai when
              possible. Lan has experience fighting the Aiel on the
              Shienaran Marches, long before the Aiel War even began. He is quite
              practiced in the <i>ko'di</i>, the Oneness, a concentration aid he uses
              to clear his mind for battle and other crucial situations.

              <a href="#Dark">Shai'tan</a>, because using his real name causes bad
              luck (at best) to anyone who speaks it.

              p. 12—Short, stocky,
              coppery-skinned Domani soldier. <a href="#Lan">Lan</a> finds him asleep
              at his post during his rounds.

            <li><a class="name" name="Jaim2">Jaim</a>, NS,
              p. 13—Gray-bearded soldier.
              <a href="#Lan">Lan</a> found him asleep at his post, still standing up,
              eyes open. He denied being asleep, but Lan knew—other seasoned
              veterans knew the trick of sleeping with their eyes open, too.
            </li>
            <li><a class="name" name="Bukama">Bukama Marenellin</a>, NS,
              p. 14—<a href="#Lan">Lan</a>'s teacher, one of the original 20 men charged
              with the task of carrying the infant prince of Malkier to safety when
              the nation was overrun; he is the only one still alive. Bluff and
              broad, he is taller than most men, almost as tall as Lan. His hair is
              solid gray, which he wears cut to the shoulder according to Malkieri
              tradition, held back by the <i>hadori</i>, a thin braided leather cord.
              He has blue eyes.
            </li>
            <li><a class="name" name="Dark">Shai'tan</a>, NS,
              p. 15—Source of all evil,
              complete antithesis of the <a href="#Creator">Creator</a> in every way.
              He was imprisoned by the Creator at the moment of Creation in a prison
              just outside the Pattern. This prison was bored into during the Age of
              Legends; the Dark One's touch on the world produced new waves of hate,
              crime, and violence that had never been seen before. An attempt to free
              the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow, a war which
              ended only with the sealing of the Bore by
              <a href="#Lews">Lews Therin Telamon</a> and the Hundred Companions.
              During the moment of sealing, the Dark One's counterstroke tainted
              <i>saidin</i> itself, beginning the Time of Madness.
              The seals on the prison were made of <i>cuendillar</i>,
              an indestructible substance, but nonetheless are beginning to weaken.
              The Dark One may touch the world again soon. Speaking his true name
              draws his attention and causes bad luck, so he is known by a plethora of
              euphemisms, most commonly as simply, “The Dark One.” Some,
              including <a href="#Bukama">Bukama</a>, believe that merely
              <i>thinking</i> his true name is enough.

              emperor who lived about a thousand years ago. He conquered most of the
              known world, and the present-day nations were carved from his
              empire.

              soldier. He has a hoarse voice and a ragged scar from an Aiel arrow to
              his throat. He likes to show off the scar when he is drinking. He
              considers himself lucky to be alive, and he is, but because of that he
              takes somewhat unnecessary chances and boasts about his luck.
            </li>
            <li><a class="name" name="Emares">Lord Emares</a>, NS,
              p. 17—General in the
              forces against the Aiel from Tear. He discovered a group of Aiel
              that followed to the east. He sent a message to <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>
              to the effect that he intended to serve as the hammer that crushed the
              Aiel into Lan's troops, who would serve as the anvil.

            <li><a class="name" name="SunLance">Sun Lance</a>, NS,

              p. 19—Beardless young
              man among <a href="#Lan">Lan</a>'s troops. The young Kandori is an
              efficient, experienced soldier, and an archer of rare skill. An almost
              cheerful killer, he often laughs while he fights.

            <li><a class="name" name="Amyrlin">Amyrlin Seat</a>, NS,
              p. 26—Leader of the
              Aes Sedai, their equivalent of a king or queen. Her authority is
              immense—rulers of all nations will obey a summons to the
              Amyrlin, even if they will spend the entire journey devising a plan to
              kill her while there. The Amyrlin, once raised, is considered to be
              “of all Ajahs and none”—she wears a stole striped with
              the seven colors of the Ajahs. The current Amyrlin is
              <a href="#Tamra">Tamra Ospenya</a>, raised from the Blue Ajah.

              p. 26—One of
              the Accepted. She grew up in the Sun Palace in Cairhien, a niece of
              <a href="#Laman">Laman</a>, King of Cairhien, and half-sister of
              <a href="#Taringail">Taringail Damodred</a>, the husband of the Queen of
              Andor. Upon entering the White Tower, she quickly formed a friendship
              with <a href="#Siuan">Siuan Sanche</a>, daughter of a Tairen fisherman.
              The two have been progressing at nearly identical paces ever since.
              Moiraine is <i>very</i> short—short even for a Cairhienin
              woman—and has very pale skin.
              She has been known to flash her temper on occasion.
              Both of her parents are dead; her mother died when she was very young.
              Like her friend Siuan, she was born with the spark of <i>saidar</i> in
              her. She will some day become one of the strongest Aes Sedai in the
              Tower. Moiraine has great respect and admiration for
              <a href="#Tamra">Tamra Ospenya</a>.

              p. 26—One of the
              Accepted. She grew up on a fishing boat in Tear, and was sent on the
              first boat bound for Tar Valon the day it was discovered she had the
              spark of <i>saidar</i> inborn, in accordance with Tairen law. Her
              parents are now dead, her mother dying when she was very young. Upon
              arriving at the Tower, she very quickly became friends with
              <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine Damodred</a>, and despite the large gap
              between their incomes and lifestyles as children, they found they had a
              remarkable amount in common. The two moved at nearly the same rate
              through their work with the Power, but Siuan seems to learn things like
              history, language, and politics at a much faster rate. In fact, she
              arrived at the Tower barely able to read, and now she teaches
              introductory classes in the Old Tongue. She has very fair skin, clear
              blue eyes, and is only a hand taller than Moiraine. She has a talent
              for puzzles. Like Moiraine, she will some day become one of the

              smiles. Waves of golden hair frame her nearly perfect face, her eyes
              look like large sapphires, and her skin is a rich creamy color. The
              only fault in her appearance, according to
              <a href="#Moiraine">Moiraine</a>, is an over-abundance of bosom. She
              is very tall, as tall as most men. She is fond of telling everyone that
              she wants to be a Green and have six Warders. She has spiky

              (though since Rand is not yet finished growing, it is possible he will
              catch Perrin eventually).
              He is also good friends with <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a>, who often
              gets Perrin and Rand into trouble.
              He has curly hair, and is very stocky and generally big.
              He is very shy and laughs seldomly; <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>
              perceives him to be dense, though she is starting to realize he may
              simply be overly contemplative and careful.
              His parents recently arranged to have him apprenticed to
              <a href="#Luhhan">Haral Luhhan</a>, the blacksmith of Emond's Field.
              Perrin has two younger sisters, <a href="#Adora">Adora</a> and
              <a href="#Deselle">Deselle</a> (eight and three, respectively) and one
              younger brother, <a href="#Paetram">Paetram</a>, who is an infant.
              As an adult, Perrin ended up about half a head shorter than Rand, and
              also a fair bit shorter than Mat as well. He is still larger of build
              than both of them, however, which works well for a blacksmith.

              He has grey eyes and reddish hair, both of which are unheard of in the

              As a twenty year-old, Rand is about a head taller than Perrin,

              Egwene, have been all but Promised to each other since they were both

              He has traveled all over the world, including the lands

              p. 268 [7]—Wisdom of Emond's Field. She is the oldest woman in Emond's
              Field, possibly in the entire Two Rivers.
              She is white-haired and frail, though still
              clear-eyed and not stooped at all. Her last apprentice died of a
              mysterious illness that she could not cure. She currently has another
              apprentice, <a href="#Nynaeve">Nynaeve al'Meara</a>, who has been
              studying under her for three years.

              p. 7 [7]—Young
              woman from Emond's Field. She has brown hair and eyes, and is quite
              slender. She has been studying under <a href="#Barran">Doral Barran</a>,
              the Wisdom of Emond's Field, for about three years. Many people in the
              village think she is too young to be apprenticed to a Wisdom, and that
              Mistress Barran should have chosen someone years older when Nynaeve's
              predecessor died mysteriously. Nynaeve is a very quick learner, and
              has been allowed to braid her hair for a year now. She has developed
              the ability to sense <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>'s presence without
              seeing her since the end of the breakbone fever epidemic. Mistress
              Barran seems to have caught on to some of Nynaeve's abilities—she
              seemed disappointed that the wound Nynaeve was bandaging did not seem
              more healed than it was when she started.
              After Mistress Barran's death, Nynaeve herself became the Wisdom.
              Her adult height is about as tall as <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>'s shoulder.
              Many people <i>still</i> think Nynaeve is too young to be the Wisdom;
              however, mentioning this to her is a good way to get whacked by the
              stick she carries.

              p. 34 [7]—A man from
              Emond's Field. According to <a href="#Egwene">Egwene</a>, he is
              always doing stupid things and always getting hurt. She has very
              little, if any, respect for him. He is of an age with
              <a href="#Luhhan">Haral Luhhan</a>, but he <i>looks</i> as though he is
              about ten years older due to his hollow cheeks and sunken eyes.
              Egwene encountered him with the Wisdom after he sliced open his leg due
              to being drunk while trying to shear sheep.
              It is later revealed that he does not believe in the
              <a href="#Dark">Dark One</a>, Darkfriends, Aes Sedai, or any of the
              other stories. He once <i>named</i> the Dark One, but when ill fortune
              struck his crops for months afterwards, he scowled at anyone (such as
              <a href="#Mat">Mat</a>) who attempted to get him to do so again.

              solid man. Keeping his word is important to him. When Tam was young,
              he left the Two Rivers to see the outside world, something which is
              extremely rare in the Two Rivers. While there he acquired a sword, and

              information she knows may not be available even in the Royal Library in
              Cairhien. She also knows about the Oneness, what Rand calls the Void.
              She also knows exactly how to use the Portal Stones, even though she
              insists she does not. As with many characters, it is likely that Selene
              is hiding her true identity.

              Iron Mountain sept of the Taardad Aiel. He was the youngest clan
              chief of the Taardad Aiel in memory. He ended the blood feud between
              the Taardad and Nakai clans after over 200 years of fighting, and then
              allied not only with the Nakai, but with the Reyn Aiel as well (who were
              not much better than blood enemies before the alliance was made). He
              almost ended the blood feud between the Shaarad and Goshien clans (which
              still persists today, causing trouble for <a href="#Chiad">Chiad</a> and
              <a href="#Gaul">Gaul</a>), and would have if

              He loved <a href="#Shaiel">Shaiel</a>, to the
              point where he could not refuse to let her fight in the Aiel War despite
              being with child. It was Janduin himself who led the four clans;
              Taardad, Nakai, Reyn, and Shaarad; across the Spine of the World to
              punish Laman for his Sin, throwing the entire world into war and
              allowing Prophecy to be fulfilled.
              It is said he was killed leading warriors in the Blight by man who
              looked so much like Shaiel that he was unable to raise his spear to
              defend himself. <i>Editor's note: It is beyond reasonable doubt that
                Janduin's killer was <a href="#Luc">Luc Mantear</a>, Shaiel's brother,

              the Red Ajah puts on its members about making friends outside the Ajah.
              She is short for a Kandori, and quite plump. She has dark eyes. She
              was once punished for voicing her desire to have a Warder; later, as a
              Sitter, when she was safer from the wrath of the Ajah, she openly
              suggested that Warders would make the job of a Red sister much easier.
              Seaine thinks she would have been happier as a Green. When she was
              small, many members of her family were killed by Darkfriends; it is for
              this reason that Seaine confides in her about searching for Darkfriends
              in the White Tower.

            <li><a class="name" name="Jeraaal">Jeraal Mordeth</a>, aCoS,
              p. 554 (711)—Name used by <a href="#Fain">Padan Fain</a> as a disguise to
              be one of <a href="#Toram">Toram Riatin</a>'s advisors. It is the name
              of the man whose soul controls about half of Fain's mind. Mordeth
              became a counsellor in Aridhol during the Trolloc
              Wars. He advised that to defeat the Shadow, Aridhol must be harder than
              the Shadow, less trusting, more cruel. Slowly it became so, until
              finally the city was, if not darker than the Shadow, as dark. The city
              finally turned on itself, consumed itself, tainting every grain of sand,
              every rock, every sip of water with its hatred. Mordeth's soul remained
              in the city, now called Shadar Logoth (“Where the Shadow
              Waits”) for millenia—he could not leave the city unless he
              accompanied a person to the city walls or had them carry something from
              the city to the outside world. Strangely enough, both of these things
              happened at the same time, when <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a> carried
              the ruby-handled dagger from the city while
              <a href="#Fain">Padan Fain</a>
              accompanied Mordeth out of the city at about the same time.
              Mordeth attempted to consume Fain's soul while the dagger tried to
              consume Mat's. In Fain's case, the attempt to consume his soul was not
              completely successful—instead, the two souls merged to create
              something more evil than either Mordeth or Fain alone. Fain now feels
              incomplete without the tainted dagger that was removed from the
              city.

            <li><a class="name" name="Jeraal">Jeraal Mordeth</a>, tPoD,

              be one of <a href="#Toram">Toram Riatin</a>'s advisers. It is the name
              of the man whose soul controls about half of Fain's mind. Mordeth
              became a counselor in Aridhol during the Trolloc
              Wars. He advised that to defeat the Shadow, Aridhol must be harder than
              the Shadow, less trusting, more cruel. Slowly it became so, until
              finally the city was, if not darker than the Shadow, as dark. The city
              finally turned on itself, consumed itself, tainting every grain of sand,
              every rock, every sip of water with its hatred. Mordeth's soul remained
              in the city, now called Shadar Logoth (“Where the Shadow
              Waits”) for millenia—he could not leave the city unless he
              accompanied a person to the city walls or had them carry something from
              the city to the outside world. Strangely enough,
              both of these things happened at the same time,
              when <a href="#Mat">Mat Cauthon</a> carried the ruby-handled
              dagger from the city while <a href="#Fain">Padan Fain</a> accompanied
              Mordeth out of the city at about the same time. Mordeth attempted to
              consume Fain's soul while the dagger tried to consume Mat's. In Fain's
              case, the attempt to consume his soul was not completely
              successful—instead, the two souls merged to create something more
              evil than either Mordeth or Fain alone. Fain now feels incomplete
              without the tainted dagger that was removed from the city.
              Mordeth, Fain, or whatever you wish to call him has since deserted
              Toram.

              long-armed Warder to <a href="#Hattori">Hattori</a> with rough-hewn
              features. He is a Blademaster. Shadows cover his eyes, and he has a
              cleft chin and a crooked nose from an unHealed break.
              He was one of two Warders who was with the eleven Aes Sedai that escaped
              Dumai's Wells, though Sleete barely escaped with his skin.
              His story could have been drawn from legends: he had lain wounded for
              hours before managing to pull himself into the saddle by the reins;
              the horse carried him, nearly unconscious, for hours before arriving
              at a village, where the villagers had been tempted to sell him to a
              group of bandits. The mayor's daughter argued for his life,
              convincing everyone that only Darkfriends would seek wounded Warders.
              The villagers hid him, and the girl nursed him to health.
              He was forced to leave in secret, as the girl had taken a liking to
              him, but in return he hunted down the bandits and killed them so they
              would never trouble the village again.
              Hattori told him she would not take a second Warder unless Sleete
              believed the person to be worthy.
              He is one of the only Warders to have ever bettered
              <a href="#Lan">Lan Mandragoran</a>, back when Lan still practiced with
              the other Warders. Sleete beat Lan in two of their seven duels, and
              Lan is widely considered the best Warder and Blademaster in the world.
              However, <a href="#Gawyn">Gawyn</a> beats Sleete in every duel, even
              when Sleete has a capable partner.
              Sleete asked Gawyn if he would be interested in being Hattori's second
              Warder; Gawyn politely declined.

              he felt uncomfortable as a butcher, his father's trade, but
              he feels at home as part of his lord's guard. He finds it somewhat
              disturbing how easily he went from cutting up dead animals to cutting up
              living people. He is a large man.

              or possibly weapon-making. He tried to pass his trade on to Bayrd as
